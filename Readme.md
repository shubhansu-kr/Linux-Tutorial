# Learn CLI - Basics of bash

I took the [Codedamn's](https://codedamn.com/) [Linux CLI - Learn the basics of bash](https://codedamn.com/learn/linux-cli-fundamentals)course as a part of Codedamn's [FUll Stack Learning Path](https://codedamn.com/learning-paths/fullstack) to learn the basic linux commands and basics of bash scripting.

This course is for absolute begginers (Not recommended If you know the basics).
